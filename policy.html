Shipping and Return Policy

ORDER PROCESSING
We try hard to get orders placed before 12:00pm PST out the same day, but occasionally during peak holiday seasons, it might take 24 hours to get your order dispatched. If you need your order by a certain date, add the date you would like to receive the order to the “notes” section. We will dispatch your order to arrive on the specified date. Please review that all information submitted is complete and accurate (e.g. name & address). Any errors made to this information may result in delayed dispatching.

SHIPPING
We go to great lengths to ensure you receive the freshest product in the most pristine condition. Most of our shipments are shipped early in the week.  We ship 2-Day orders Monday - Wednesday and Overnight orders Monday - Thursday. Why don’t we ship your order Friday - Sunday? Because having your chocolate sit over the weekend can cause one melty mess!  If you are shipping a package to a warm weather destination over a weekend, your package may be held until the following Monday to ensure minimal time in transit. However, during warm weather (above 80 degrees Fahrenheit), we highly recommend selecting the overnight shipping option. 
Please note Truffle Escape Chocolates cannot be held responsible for damage to the packages (heat or otherwise) that may occur during shipping. We work hard to prevent any damage during transit; however, once the products leave our store, any damage that may occur is out of our hands. We are also not responsible for shipping delays caused by our shipping provider due to weather or any other circumstances beyond our control.

PACKAGING
To reduce the risk of melted chocolate in transit to warmer climates (65 degrees and higher), we use insulated packaging and gel packs to protect the chocolates. It can get very hot in the back of a delivery truck!

DELIVERY TIMES FOR BUSINESSES & RESIDENCES
All of our shipping vendors only deliver on business days, unless Saturday delivery is specified (where available, additional charges apply). Our shipping vendors may require a signature for delivery at the discretion of the driver. Deliveries to businesses typically occur between 8 am and 5 pm, and deliveries to residences can typically occur between 9 am and 7 pm

WHEN WILL MY ORDER ARRIVE?
Once we fulfill your order a tracking number will be sent to you via email and can be used to track your package.  In order to ensure the best possible product, orders cannot ship over the weekend most of the time. Thus, standard shipment packages may be held until the following Monday to ensure minimal time in transit.
